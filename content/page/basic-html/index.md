# Contents matter more than looks

When blogging, it's easy to get caught up in the looks of the website and ending up spending a bunch of time in website designing.
Check out [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com/)'s website. It's a good example of a website that is not modern, but has good content.


Q:  *Why don't you make your website look modern?*

## Stroustrup's answer to the question:

>I'm a "contents provider" not a website designer. I can use my time to improve the contents or the looks, but not both.
What looks "cool and modern" to someone is often considered bad taste by someone else, and fashions change fast. Also, very plain html downloads and displays faster than anything else, and many people still suffer from slow web connections.

You can see the original post [here](https://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#looks).


I strongly recommend you to read posts in [basic html](/basic-html/post).
